PRD — Church Site Template + Leader Editor Platform
1. Overview

Build a reusable church website template system with a custom leader editing portal.

The system allows non-technical church leaders to log in and update all content (text, images, links, colors, logos, headers, etc.) across five fixed pages:

Home

Events

Next Steps

About

Contact

The public site layout and component order are fixed and cannot be changed by leaders.
Leaders may edit any content fields but cannot move, remove, or reorder components.

The platform must be reusable across multiple churches with identical structure and editor experience.

2. Goals
Primary Goals

Leaders can update site content without coding knowledge.

Layout consistency is enforced across all churches.

Editors never access WordPress admin or any CMS admin UI.

Editing feels modern, simple, and safe.
